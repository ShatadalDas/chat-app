# Bubble
- It's a chat app that allows you to chat with your friends and family
- The Frontend uses React.js, Typescript, SCSS, SocketIO-Client, etc.
- The Backend uses Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, etc. (used typescript at the time of development)
- From Designing through Development to Deployment, all by my own.
